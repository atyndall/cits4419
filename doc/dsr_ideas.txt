IDEAS!!!!!!
General idea:
- node learns the route path through route discovery, route request, route reply, sending packet and by overhearing data.

Route maintenance - packet salvaging, route shortening, error propagation, caching negative information
============================================
Performance measurement
============================================
Evaluate performance of DSR based on Quality of Service (measurement used in most paper)
- Collision: occurring when more than one nodes trying to acquire the channel/resources at the same time

- Throughput (bits per second): (Rate of sending and receiving data packets)/simulation time

- Latency Rate: time to deliver the packet from source to destination.

- Packet Loss/Drop: Error condition which packet never arrive to the destination, possibly due to corrupted packets/broken link/insufficient bandwidth.


============================================
Route reply storm
============================================
Delay before sending reply (Ahmad, Awan, Waqqas, Ahmad 2008) & (Broch, Johnson, Maltz 2007)
- Delay time = H x ( h - 1 + r )
	*H: constant delay per hop
	*h: total number of hops to reach destination
	*r: random number
- tradeoff between delay and collisions
	*less packet drops + slightly better throughput
	*more delay time.


============================================
Shortest path
============================================
Ant algorithm (Istikmal 2013)
- finding the shortest path using ant colony optimisation approach. 
- tradeoff between good performance and overhead:
	*good performance: 48% smaller delay, 1.37 times smaller hop count, up to 3.6 times throughput
	*but 58% larger overhead.

ordered walk with learning (OWL) (Dabideen, Garcia-Luna-Aceves 2009)
- DFS based routing + ordered walk search algorithm.

BFS
- very popular choice; fastest approach to finding the desired routes [average time of O(log_k N)].
- but signaling overhead of O(N) incurred (Generally not good for large network due to long queue delays or packet losses)
	
============================================
Route cache and Route discovery
============================================
Optimising the efficiency of route discovery (Seet, Lee, Lau 2003)
- if a node overhears a RREP for an unseen RREQ, node record: 
	1) hop-length of return source route; 
	2) RREQ ID
	3) RREQ source address
- node compare hop-length, reply if it has a shorter route; discard otherwise

Route request hop limit
- Whenever request is forwarded, limit is decremented. if the limit reaches 0 before finding the target, discard the request packet.
Can be use for Propagating route request if target through:
	- If target is not found within the source's neighbourhood within a short timeout, source sends a propagating RREQ using the DiscoveryHopLimit
	- Expanding ring search. Hop limit starts with 1, continues to increment this limit

Route error propagation
============================================




============================================
Possible future work
============================================
- Use Global Positioning System (GPS) to determine the location of node (Basagni,Chlamtax, Syrotiuk 1999);
